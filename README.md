Run the program:
	
	python mission_assign.py -f <input file path>
	
Requirements:
	
	Python Constraint: pip install git+https://github.com/python-constraint/python-constraint.git
	
Notes:
1. Program will generate a file named <input filename>_output.txt with mission assignments, if it is possible. 
2. If the program is taking too long, a timeout will occur automatically after 90 seconds. 
3. Ouput is written in the same directory as the input.
